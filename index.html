        <div class="subheading mb-5">Music (Performance)ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽµ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have been performing since 2013 & I have received awards from my teachers & fellow peers for my passion. I continued to do choir until the day I graduated high school to which I have received multiple awards and medals with all the groups I have been a part of. During my years in high school, I have helped with multiple events that were held by my high school choirs. Some of the events I helped with were our concerts, fundraisers, Valentine's day, & many more. As a secretary in the intermediate & president in the women's choir in my junior & senior years respectively, I was in charge of taking attendance for all of the events & rehearsals. Including my senior year, I was one of the oldest students in the class & had the most choir experience, I was placed in charge to be the representative for the class in officer meetings for all of the choirs. I am still doing choir now at UCR, but for the choirs here almost all of the performances have been online so I have not been able to set up for anything. My senior year as an honor choir member was different since we were the top group of our school, we were placed in charge of virtual performances like for the winter assembly; we sang a Christmas song which we all recorded separately. As well for our introduction to the future and continuing students of our school, we practiced & recorded ourselves for club rush. During my final concert, my choir recorded ourselves singing & performing certain moves for the camera. Not only that, I got a duet with my friend with our performance of "Something There" from Beauty & The Beast; he was the Beast, LumiÃ¨re, & Cogsworth whereas I was Belle & Mrs. Potts. For our duet, I spent my time editing our voices, music, & videos together so we could submit them to our director. My last performance was my graduation, the honor choir, some of the intermediate choir members & all of the seniors that were in the choir sang "The Climb" at the beginning of the ceremony. Continuing back to the other activities I have done, I was in Korean club for all four years as well. I have helped with painting/holding our backdrops for our international performances, & performed with them as a dancer for international & flashmob. During my junior year as the treasurer, I helped calculated our total values for the club, kept the bookstore & club updated about our club balance of how much we could spend for the year. When we had our fundraising events like selling grams & during our performances, I kept everything on track on how much we were selling & making sure everyone got the amount of change if they gave extra. Last but not least, it is my final time in Tri-M which was my high school's music honor society. During my time there, I volunteered for a few different virtual events held by the club. I made singing cards for the elderly before the holidays. I practiced several songs before choosing two to record for those cards. Since this was during COVID, it was hard to do physical volunteering without getting others in danger.
